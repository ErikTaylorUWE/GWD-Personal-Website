                    <p class="overall-description">Initially this assignment felt overwhelming. I had no experience with Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator and regarding HTML and CSS this website is the second website I've ever made. However, as the weeks went by and following along closely to my lecturer's tutorials it became less and less daunting and I ended up really enjoying the overall process.</p>

                    <p class="overall-description">Opening Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator for the first time my screen was flooded with daunting icons, a multitude of options I felt completely lost. However, when learning one tool the rest became easier to use, as they all share similarities. Sometimes I'd want to manipulate an image in a certain way but only had the idea in my head and no actual know-how on how to use Photoshop, for example, to create my desired outcome. This led to countless google searches, YouTube tutorials and reading forum posts. An example of this was when I initially saw this adobe stock image:</p>


                    <img class="poster-image" src="images/adobe_stock_img.jpeg" alt="picture of adobe stock image of female skateboarder">

                    <p class="overall-description">I wanted to remove the background but keep the ramps to incorporate the image into my poster design idea. This ended up being a simple problem to fix as Photoshop makes it incredibly easy to isolate objects from their backgrounds. I did run into some issues where I had to learn about the 'Rasterize layer' function to actually do this and in order to keep the ramps from being included in the removed background I had to play around with the object select tool and magic wand tool, which I quickly familiarized myself with but Photoshop had missed a few areas which I had to manually clean up with the eraser. Once I had done this, I got the idea of making the image look hand drawn. After some more research, this got me messing around with the desaturation tool, inverting the desaturated image's colours, using the “colour dodge” tool in combination with the “minimum” filter and then finally playing around with the colour levels. After doing all this I was happy with the result: </p>

                    <p class="overall-description">Typography is a role in design I had definitely overlooked. Once I began delving deeper into the 8 typographical systems it became apparent that the importance of a well thought up and executed use of typography goes a long way into the overall design of a poster or website. I found creating the transitional system most enjoyable and challenging. The modular system, however, was a concept I struggled to fully grasp.</p>

                    <p class="overall-description">Attending last year's Comp-Sci foundation year had me create a website from scratch, similar to this assignment. The feedback I received was positive, but I over commented my code, had poor file management, and weak use of semantic tags. I looked back on what I had done last year to refresh my memory and in my opinion my code was a complete mess and I had not fully used cascading in CSS in fact I had almost avoided it. So, this time around I decided I'd try and focus on what went wrong last time and even though my website is very basic, I believe it gets the job done and the code is very easy to read and understand.</p>

                    <p class="overall-description">Despite my limited knowledge, my skills in Adobe's design tools and HTML/CSS have significantly grown and I look forward to learning more.</p>
